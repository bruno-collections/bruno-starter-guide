  ## Challenge Overview
  
  In the previous challenge, you sent a `POST` request and got a JSON response using Bruno’s echo server.
  
  Now let’s explore how you can **log and inspect** the request and response using the **Console** tab and DevTools.

  ## Instructions
  
  > 💡 **Tip:**  
  > - The `req` object is only available in the **Pre-Script** section.  
  > - The `res` object is only available in the **Post Script** section.
  
  ### ✅ Step 1: Use `req` object in Pre-Script
  
  1. Open your request from `Challenge-03`.
  2. Go to the **Pre Script** section.
  3. Add the following code:
  
  ```js
     console.log(req.getUrl());
  ``` 
  
  4. Open the **Console Tab** (`Ctrl + I` or click on **Console** from the context menu).
  5. Click **->** to execute the request.
  
  🔍 You should see the **URL** of your request logged in the console!

  ### ✅ Step 2: Use `res` object in Post Script
  
  Now let’s try it in the **Post Script** section:
  
  1. Navigate to the **Post Script** tab.
  2. Add the following:
  
  ```js
     console.log(res.getBody());
  ```
  
  Execute the request again.
  
  🎉 You’ll see the response body printed in the console—just like what you see in the Response tab!
  
  ## 📌 Summary
  In this challenge, you learned how to:
  
  ✅ Log request URL using req.getUrl() in Pre Script
  
  ✅ Log response body using res.getBody() in Test Script
  
  ✅ Use Bruno’s Console and DevTools for effective debugging
  
  Keep experimenting and have fun with the logs! 🎮
