  ## Instructions
  
  > 💡 **Tip:**  
  > - The `req` object is only available in the **Pre-Script** section.  
  > - The `res` object is only available in the **Post Script** section.
  
  ### ✅ Step 1: Use `req` object in Pre-Script
  
  1. Open your request from `Challenge-03`.
  2. Go to the **Pre Script** section.
  3. Add the following code:
  
  ```js
     req.setBody({
     "name": "Bruno",
     "role": "Chief Joy Officer"
     })
  ``` 
  
  5. Click **->** to execute the request.
  
  🔍 You should see the the data we sent in your response tab.

  ### ✅ Step 2: Use `res` object in Post Script
  
  Now let’s try it in the **Post Script** section:
  
  1. Navigate to the **Post Script** tab.
  2. Add the following:
  
  ```js
     console.log(res.getBody());
  ```
  
  Execute the request again.
  
  🎉 You’ll see the response body printed in the console—just like what you see in the Response tab!
