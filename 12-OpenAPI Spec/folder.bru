  # 12 - Working with OpenAPI Specification
  
  Welcome to Challenge 12 of the Bruno Starter Guide!
  
  In this challenge, you'll learn how to view and import OpenAPI Specifications (OAS) into Bruno as a collection and view OAS files.
  
  ### ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Learn
  - âœ… How to import an OpenAPI V3 spec into Bruno
  - âœ… View and explore an API definition as a Bruno collection
  - âœ… Understand how Bruno converts OpenAPI endpoints into testable requests
  
  ### Challenge Overview
  
  OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger) is a standard format for describing REST APIs. Bruno has excellent support for working with OpenAPI specs, allowing you to import them as collections.
  
  ### Instructions
  
  #### Step 1: Find an OpenAPI Specification
  
  You can use any OpenAPI spec, but for this challenge, we recommend:
  
  - The Petstore API: [https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json](https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json)
  - Or download a sample OpenAPI spec from [https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/tree/main/examples](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/tree/main/examples)
  
  #### Step 2: Import the OpenAPI Spec
  
  1. Open Bruno
  2. Click on the context menu (three dots) next to the Bruno logo
  3. Select "Import"
  4. Choose "OpenAPI"
  5. Browse for your OpenAPI spec file or paste the URL
  6. Follow the import wizard
  7. Choose a location to save the collection
  
  #### Step 3: Explore the Imported Collection
  
  After importing, you'll see:
  
  1. A new collection created with the API name
  2. Folders organized by resource/tag
  3. Requests for each endpoint with:
     - Correct paths
     - Sample parameters
     - Authentication methods
     - Request bodies
  
  #### Step 4: Test an Endpoint
  
  1. Navigate through the imported collection
  2. Select an endpoint (e.g., GET /pets)
  3. Review request details that Bruno has pre-configured
  4. Click Send to test the endpoint
  
  ### ðŸ“Œ Summary
  
  In this challenge, you:
  
  - âœ… Imported an OpenAPI specification into Bruno
  - âœ… Explored how Bruno organizes API definitions
  - âœ… Tested API endpoints directly from the imported spec
  
  Bruno's OpenAPI import feature helps you quickly start testing APIs without manually creating each request, saving time and ensuring accuracy.
