  ## 🛠️ Instructions
  
  ### 📁 Step 1: Create a `.env` File
  
  1. Open your code editor (e.g., **VS Code**).
  2. Navigate to your **Bruno collection folder**.
  3. Create a new file named `.env` at the **root level** of the collection.
  4. Add the following variable inside the `.env` file:
  
  ```bash
    my_secret_key=1234567890
  ```
  
  > **Always add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore`** to ensure secrets are not accidentally pushed to version control.
