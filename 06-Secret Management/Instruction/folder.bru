  ## 📘 Challenge Overview
  
  ## Instructions
  
  ### Step 1: Mark Environment Variable as Secret
  
  1. Open Bruno and select your environment.
  
  2. Add a new variable:
  
  ```json
    Key: my_secret_key
    Value: Bruno'
  ```
  
  TEnable the "Secret" checkbox next to the variable.
  
  Bruno will now treat this value as a secret—redacting it from logs and previews to protect sensitive data.
  
  ### ✉️ Step 2: Use the Secret Variable in a Request
  
  1. In the `instruction` folder, create a request named: `env-secret`.
  
  2. Set the method to POST.
  
  3. Enter `{{base-url}` URL placeholder and select `echo bruno` as environment.
  
  4. Go to the Body tab and select JSON.
  
  5. Add this JSON:
  
  ```json
  {
    "secret": "{{my_secret_key}}"
  }
  ```
  
  6. Run the request.
  
  You’ll see the secret value reflected in the response—but it remains hidden in logs and previews for safety.
