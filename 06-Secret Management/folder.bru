  # 06 - Secret Management
  
  Welcome to Day 6 of the Bruno Starter Guide!
  
  Bruno is a local-first API client, and one of its key features is the ability to safely manage secrets like API keys, tokens, and passwords—directly through environment variables.
  
  In this challenge, you'll learn how to mark sensitive values as secrets in Bruno environments. This ensures that these values are handled securely and never logged or exposed accidentally.
  
  ### 🎯 What You'll Learn
  
  - 🔐 How to mark variables as secrets in Bruno environments
  
  - 🛡️ How secrets behave securely in Bruno (e.g., redacted in logs)
  
  ### Secret Management
  
  ### 📘 Challenge Overview
  
  ### Instructions
  
  #### Step 1: Mark Environment Variable as Secret
  
  1. Go to environment variables (top-right) and select `echo-bruno`.
  
  2. Add a new variable:
  
  ```json
    Key: my_secret_key
    Value: Bruno
  ```
  
  3. Enable the "Secret" checkbox next to the variable.
  
  Bruno will now treat this value as a secret—redacting it from logs and previews to protect sensitive data.
  
  #### ✉️ Step 2: Use the Secret Variable in a Request
  
  1. Create a request named: `env-secret`.
  
  2. Set the method to `POST`.
  
  3. Enter `{{base-url}}` URL placeholder and select `echo bruno` as environment.
  
  4. Go to the `Body` tab and select `JSON`.
  
  5. Add this JSON:
  
  ```json
  {
    "secret": "{{my_secret_key}}"
  }
  ```
  
  6. Run the request.
  
  You'll see the secret value reflected in the response—but it remains hidden in logs and previews for safety.
  
  ### 📌 Summary
  In this challenge, you learned how to:
  
  - ✅ Mark environment variables as secrets in Bruno
  
  - ✅ Use secret variables securely in requests
  
  You're one step closer to mastering secure and private API testing with Bruno! 🔐🚀
