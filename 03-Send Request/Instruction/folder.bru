  # Challenge Overview 
  
  ## Instructions
  
  ### Step 1: Create a New Request
  
  1. Click on the **Collection** in your Bruno workspace.
  2. Click on the **Context Menu** (...) and select **New Request**.
  3. Name your request as `Your Name`.
  4. Set the **Request URL** to `https://echo.usebruno.com`.
  
  ### Step 2: Set HTTP Method to POST
  
  1. In your new request, select the **POST** method from the dropdown next to the URL field.
  
  ### Step 3: Add JSON Body Data
  
  1. In the **Body** section, select **JSON** from the dropdown.
  2. Add the following JSON data to the body of the request:
  
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Bruno",
    "role": "Chief Joy Officer"
  }
  ```
  
  ### Step 4: Execute the Request
  
  Click on **->** to execute the request.
  
  You should receive the following response:
  
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Bruno",
    "role": "Chief Joy Officer"
  }
  ```
  
  ### Step 5: Debugging with Console
  
  You can use the `console.log()` method to log the response. For example, add the following line inside the **Test Script** tab:
  
  ```javascript
  console.log(res.getBody());
  ```
  
  This will log the response body in the Console tab, so you can easily debug and inspect the output.
