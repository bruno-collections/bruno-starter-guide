  2. Select `Settings` from the dropdown.
  
  3. You will see `Documentations` in right-hand side.
  
  4. Click the ✏️ pencil icon like you're about to write your next API novel.
  
  5. Add the following markdown at the bottom 
  
  ```md
  ## Bruno Starter Guide Progress:
  
  1. Name: <your-awesome-name>
  2. Task: API Documentations
  3. Mood: 😎 
  ```
  
  #### Step 2: Add Folder-Level Docs
  
  1. Right-click on the `API Documentation` folder.
  2. Select setting from dropdown.
  3. Go to Docs tab and Paste this content:

  #### Step 3: Add Request-Level Docs

  2. Go to `Docs` tab.
  3. Click on `Edit` and paste the following content:
  
  ```md
  # Request-Level API Documentation
  
  Below are the some API documentation best practices:
  
  - Clarity: Clearly describe the purpose of the request and how to use it.
  - Examples: Include sample requests and responses to help users test quickly.

  ```
  
  A well-documented API is a happy API! 🚀
