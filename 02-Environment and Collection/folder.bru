  In this challenge, you'll learn how to use **environment variables** in Bruno. You'll be able to create and manage different environments to test your APIs under various conditions. 
  
  By the end of this challenge, you'll understand how to:
  
  - Set up different environments at the collection level.
  - Use environment variables to make your API tests dynamic.
  
  ### Challenge Overview
