  ### 🎯 What You'll Learn
  
  - 🌐 How to get and use an **API key** for authentication
  - 🔑 Storing API keys securely using **Environment Variables**
  - 🔎 Sending authenticated requests using **Query Params** in Bruno
  
  ### Challenge Overview
  
  #### 📰 What is News API?
  
  **News API** is a simple HTTP API for searching and retrieving live articles from all over the web.
  
  - **Website:** [https://newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org)

  #### 🗝️ Step 1: Get Your API Key
  
  1. Go to [https://newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org)
  2. Sign up or log in to your account.
  3. From your dashboard, **copy your API Key**.
  
  #### 🔐 Step 2: Store the API Key as an Environment Variable
  
  To keep your API key secure and reusable:
  
  1. Go to Bruno Starter Guide collection.
  2. Navigate to the **Environment Variables** (top right).
  3. Configure new enviroment called **NEWS_API**
  4. Click on **Add Variable**.
  5. Add:
  
     - **Key:** `news-api-key`
     - **Value:** *(paste your News API key)*
  
  > 🛡️ Tip: Avoid hardcoding your API key directly in requests—use variables instead!
  
  #### 🔄 Step 3: Create Request Using the API Key
  
  Let's send a request to News API to get news articles about Tesla.
  
  1. Create a new request named `News Articles`.
  2. Set the **Method** to `GET`.
  3. Use the following URL:
   ```bash  
     https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=tesla&from=2025-03-22&sortBy=publishedAt
   ```
  4. Go to the **Auth** tab of your request.
  5. Choose **API Key** from the dropdown.
  6. Fill in the following:
     - **Key:** `apiKey`
     - **Value:** `{{news-api-key}}`
  7. Set the **Add To** option to: `Query Params`
  
  ✅ Bruno will now append your API key to the URL as a query parameter.
  
  ### 🚀 Step 5: Execute the Request
  
  Click **Send** to run the request.
  
  You should receive a JSON response with a list of news articles related to **Tesla**.
